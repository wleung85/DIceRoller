# DiceRoller
This basic Python script parses dice roll strings commonly found in pen & paper games such as D&D and calculates the answer.

For example, the string "2d20 + 3" translates to rolling 2 twenty-sided dice and adding 3.

The API returns the answer in the form of a list, where index 0 = result and the other indices are the results of the dice rolls.
